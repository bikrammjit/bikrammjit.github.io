### [Data Retrieval and Mining Tool - Independent Research Study (Summer 2016)](https://github.com/bikdroid/UTDrepo) 
+ Developed a project for mining information on students and alumnus from data collected from social and online portals.
+ Implemented RESTful services in **Python**, **Django** and **MongoDB** for *data parsing* module, *search*, *login*, *authorization*, *advanced search* module.
+ Implemented internal controller modules for authorizations, database operations and API integrations.

### [Search Engine (Web based service) (Java, JSP, Lucene, SOLR, Nutch)](https://bikrammjit.github.io/projects)
+ Developed a search engine over 120,000 documents relevant to automobiles (brands, sales, blogs, news).
+ The documents were crawled and stored using Nutch 1.4
+ The indexing system was implemented using SOLR 4.10 platform. Implemented PageRank with TFIDF and Okapi weighting scheme
+ Query time relevance was also implemented to test the effect of HITS algorithm on the results, which clearly showed improvement

### [Search Engine Index Compression (Java, Stanford core NLP, Linux)](https://github.com/bikdroid/vector-space-relevance-model) 
+ Lemmatization of valid tokens and storage. Implemented dictionary compression using Front Coding.
+ Postings lists and specific document statistics were compressed using Gamma and Delta compressions respectively.
+ Reduction of approximately 65% in full index size was evident after compression for the Cranfield dataset.

### [Website Fingerprinting Counter attack â€“ Big Data (Python, Numpy, Hadoop, full ETL pipeline)](https://github.com/bikdroid/Website-Fingerprinting---CS-6350---UT-Dallas-Spring-2016) 
+ Worked alongside a PhD researcher to develop software to counterattack phishing attackers through machine learning and analytics.
+ Implemented **Python** modules for ML analytics, which adapts the *On-line learning* system to the best Ensemble model.
+ We achieved an average 70% accuracy at best using our Ensemble of classifications. Wrote *1000+ lines of Python code*.
