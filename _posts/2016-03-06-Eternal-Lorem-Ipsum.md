It is interesting how blogging has become so integral part of our lives and a representation of who we are, who we can be and more.
In these times of excessive social presence and activity, do not miss out on the idea of a Personal space, just like this one !
It's self-empowering !

Trust me this will be fast, just a set of programs and commands, you don't need to be a compsci or IT insider to do this !
